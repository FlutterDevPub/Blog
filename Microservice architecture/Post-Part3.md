# Web app using Microservices in Go: Part 3 - Storage and Master

## Introduction

In this part we will implement the next part of the microservices needed for our web app. We will implement the:
* Storage system
* Master

This way we will have the *Master API* ready when we'll be writing the slaves/workers and the frontend. And we'll already have the database, k/v store and storage when writing the master. SO every time we write something we'll already have all its dependencies.
